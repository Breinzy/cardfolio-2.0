# Cursor Rules of Engagement

1. **Follow the Roadmap Order**  
   – Complete Stage 0 tasks before touching Stage 1, and so on.

2. **One Task ≙ One Commit**  
   – Finish a single atomic change, run checks, then `git commit -m "<stage>: <task>"`.

3. **Write Tests for Every New Module**  
   – Add/extend `tests/…` with Pytest for each feature or bug‑fix.

4. **Run CI Locally Before Push**  
   ```bash
   ruff .
   black --check .
   mypy .
   pytest

    Keep Functions Small & Typed
    – ≤ 30 LOC per function, with Pydantic models where relevant.

    Never Skip Lint or Type Errors
    – Code must be green on ruff, black, mypy, and pytest.

    Touch Only One Layer at a Time
    – Avoid frontend + backend + DB changes in the same PR.

    Document Every Public Function
    – Include a short docstring explaining purpose and I/O.

    Ask for Clarification When Ambiguous
    – If a requirement isn’t clear, pause and get confirmation.

    No Untracked Files
    – Commit or ignore; working tree should stay clean.
